    /*
    Lets explain lines 43-45. isNaN() is a function that returns a boolean, and it stands for "is Not a Number".
    Basically it checks to see if the value you pass it as a parameter (in this case, inputAmount), is a number
    or not. If it IS A NUMBER, it will return false. If it IS NOT A NUMBER, it will return true (kind of backwards
    to how you'd expect, but it makes sense considering the name of the function).

    If the value is indeed a number (ie. isNaN returns false), you create a variable called "convertedValue",
    and set its value to the "inputAmount", multiplied by the "targetValue.value". 

    This is the interesting part. targetValue is of type Currency (as specified within the parrameters of the
    "buttonPressed" function on line 30). This "data type" was created in the "index.d.ts" file, using an
    interface. Within a Currency, it has four characteristics, or member variables if you will: name, value,
    flag, and symbol. You are simply grabbing the "value" of the specific currency passed as a parameter into
    the function call, and multiplying inputAmount by its value to convert the inputAmount to the desired currency.

    In line 45, you create a variable called "result", in which you use Template Literal Syntax to construct a string.
    ${targetValue.symbol} uses the value of targetValue.symbol (Remember coz its of type Currency, it has this
    member variable, lok at index.d.ts file for a better understanding), and adds a currency symbol in front of it,
    in this case $. Then ${convertedValue.toFixed(2)} takes the "convertedValue" variable you made in line 44,
    and uses the .toFixed() method to format the number to 2 decimal places, and similarly adds a currency value
    to the front, in this case, also $.
